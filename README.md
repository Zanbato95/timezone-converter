#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/QG41cRfyEzc
## Description:
The Time Zone Converter is a simple and useful tool to convert your schedule to different time zones.

This app was built entirely using [Vue2](https://vuejs.org/) with it's primary package of use is [Moment JS](https://momentjs.com/). Using the Vue framework, I've been able to apply separate component functionality and make my application reactive to each input. 

I hope you'll find this tool helpful :)
